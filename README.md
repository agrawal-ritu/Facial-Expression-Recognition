# Facial_Expression_Recognition
Implementation of Facial Expression Recognition using Computer Vision Methodology

This is an academic project for course Info 6105- Data Science Engineering methods and Tools(Statistical Learning).

Team Members:

Ritu Agrawal || agrawal.ritu@husky.neu.edu

Nikhil Kashid || kashid.n@husky.neu.edu


Technology Stack-

Language- Python

Libraries
1. OpenCV
2. Tensorflow with Keras

Dataset- 
The dataset could be accessed from the link-
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

There are three jupyter notebooks:
Facial_Expression_Recognition_using_CNN- This is final notebook which has a CNN model built from scratch with the highest accuracy in the three implemented models.

Facial_Expression_Recognition_using_VGG19- Uses the VGG19 architecture for the facial expression recognition

ResidualNeuralNetworkArchitecture- Uses the prebuit Residual Network 

Thank you!
